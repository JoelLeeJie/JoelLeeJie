# Showcase of my Projects

# CerealBox C++ 3D Engine [Current]
Leading a 13-man interdisciplinary team to design and implement scalable, maintainable systems for cross-platform software development (Windows, Android).
Empowered the team’s programming expertise by mentoring members on C++ coding guidelines and design patterns, leading to well-structured and cleaner code.

A 3D Game Engine (in-progress) that is being built with scalability and maintainability in mind, using modern design practices and techniques.

# Game and Engine Development (C++, OpenGL)
  Showcase: [Link](https://youtu.be/E8yu4OGotPs)  
 
Led a team of 8 in the development of a custom game engine, implemented in C++ and OpenGL.  

Developed a modular C++ game engine in an 8-member team with component-based architecture to enable flexible real-time behaviours, over 6 months.  
Implemented scripting, reflection and a performant OpenGL rendering pipeline, integrated into the released game.  
Continuously improved engine architecture through iterative refactoring using best practices and design patterns, leading to better readability and scalability in the growing codebase.  

Done as part of my Y2 project, it helped me to better understand how systems should be designed for scalability + maintainability, and I often had to backtrack and reiterate on the engine architecture. Working in a medium-sized team allowed me to improve my teamwork and communication skills over this 6 month period, which came into play for my 13-man long-term engine project.

Features:  
 ECS architecture  
 2D lighting   
 Font loading via FreeType and Texture Atlasing   
 Run-time compilation and loading of logic scripts  
and more

# Video-Player (C++, FFmpeg)
  Showcase: [Link](https://youtu.be/Bcz6F4j5YMg)  
  Repo: [Link](https://github.com/JoelLeeJie/Video-Player)  

Created a C++ video player by integrating FFmpeg and SDL2 for real-time rendering of multimedia content streamed from file. Implements common features such as pause/play, seeking and integration of windows file explorer.

As my second major project, I experimented with implementing better code using RAII, separation of responsibilities, and other modern design practices. Whilst not my finest work, it deepened my understanding of software development and improved my code quality for future projects.

# Genshin Database (C#, SQL and Database)  
  Showcase: [Link](https://youtu.be/OqJ2aEUyNsA)  
  Repo: [Link](https://github.com/JoelLeeJie/GenshinDatabase)  

Built an interactive database application using C#, SQL that enabled quick storage and retrieval of varied datasets based on game data.
Integrated automated data collection (via web scraping) and a user-friendly interface, allowing end-users to view updated detailed statistics about the game.

This was my first major project, done before I entered university. As a passion project of mine, it helped me to grow as a programmer by implementing what I only learnt through textbooks before. 
I believe every programmer should make something that they like at least once, and this project was my shot at it.


# Game Project (Team of 5, C++, OpenGL)    
  Showcase: [Link](https://youtu.be/ldsFohg6y7M)  

A game project I worked on with a team of 5, over 3 months.  
Created using a proprietary library, in C++.
